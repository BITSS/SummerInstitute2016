    "contents" : "---\ntitle: \"Short PDF example of R Markdown\"\nauthor: \"Garret Christensen\"\ndate: \"Thursday February 11, 2016\"\noutput: pdf_document\n---\n\nOne Click! Knit PDF and you're done.\n===============================================================\nYou only have to install a package once, but you have to load the library every time you want to use it. You'll see that a bunch of ugly commands and output gets displayed. You probably wouldn't really want that in your actual paper.\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}\n#install.packages(\"foreign\")\nlibrary(foreign)\n#install.packages(\"stargazer\")\nlibrary(stargazer)\n#install.packages(\"sandwich\")\nlibrary(sandwich)\n\n```\n\nWhich is why you can turn off code (with echo=FALSE) and/or results (with results='hide'). You're not going to see anything from this chunk here: \n\n<!-- Note that since Markdown (and R Markdown) is related to HTML, you can put comments in the non-code part of the doc with HTML comment syntax. --> \n```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}\n# Permanently set echo OFF!\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo=FALSE)\npi<-3.14159\nprint(pi)\n```\n\nThis is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.\n\nWhen you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:\n\n```{r}\nsummary(cars)\n```\n\nLoading the data\n----------------\nYou can bring in the Stata data directly with the 'foreign' package.\n\n```{r, echo = FALSE }\nWASHB<-read.dta(\"WASHBpublic_mock.dta\")\n```\n\nRunning Analysis\n-----------------\nI ran some regression analysis. The results are good.\n```{r, echo = FALSE}\n#Model 1=simple model\nmodel1<-lm(free_chl_yn~treatw, data=WASHB)\n#Model 2=with hetero-robust se's--a bit more complicated than Stata\ncov <- vcovHC(model1, type = \"HC\")\nrobust.se <- sqrt(diag(cov))\n#Model 3=add baseline control variables\nmodel3<-lm(free_chl_yn~treatw+kiswahili+english, data=WASHB)\n```\n\nGraphics\n========\nGraphics can be easily inlaid.\nHere, I'll make a map of the number of US military recruits to a 16 year period by county.\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE}\nplot(haz06~waz06, data=WASHB)\n```\n\nEquations\n==========\nEquations written with LaTeX syntax works, so you can write short reports all in one file.\n$$ \\frac{dN}{dt} = r * N * (1 - \\frac{N}{K})$$\n\nRefer to Values\n===============\nYou can refer to values calculated in R by just surrounding \"r\" and the code with single accent marks. \nFor example, the mean frequency is `r mean(WASHB$treatw, na.rm=TRUE)`.\n\n\nSimple Output\n==============\nYou can just use built in R functionality.\n\n```{r}\nsummary(model1)\nsummary(model3)\n```\n\nFancier Output\n==============\nMarkdown is designed to be simple and also readable by humans in marked-up form. Like I said, mark*down*, not mark*up*. But you can still get really nicely formatted regression output with a couple of R packages, xtable or stargazer. (Very similar to estout or outreg2 in Stata.)\n\nStargazer has three types of output (text, html, and LaTeX). \n\nTeX->PDF\n---------------\nWhen we Knit a Markdown as a PDF, it actually makes that PDF using LaTeX. (See [here](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/pdf_document_format.html).) So you can use the .tex output option from stargazer and get nice PDF documentation.\n\n```{r, results='asis'}\nstargazer(model1, model1, model3, se=list(NULL, robust.se, NULL), title=\"Made Automatically in R\", out=\"outputR.tex\")\n```\n\n\nEverything All in One Place?\n=====================\nYou can do [citations](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html). Plots, graphs, and citations, what else do you need for a research paper?\n\nYou could also maybe try Sweave (direct combo of LaTeX and R). Or, just like in Stata, you could send your output to .tex files, and include those in your master paper file.\n",
