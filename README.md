# BITSS 2016 Summer Institute

Welcome to the Github Repo for BITSS 2016 Summer Institute. Here you'll find a few slides for the meeting, probably written in LaTeX. The workshop agenda, as well as most of the PowerPoint or PDF sets of slides can be found on the companion [OSF project site](https://osf.io/qh2nr/).
